# Assets Required

You need to create the following assets in this directory:

1. **icon.png** - 1024x1024px app icon
2. **splash.png** - 1242x2436px splash screen (recommended)
3. **adaptive-icon.png** - 1024x1024px Android adaptive icon
4. **favicon.png** - 48x48px web favicon

For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:

- Online tools like https://www.appicon.co/
- Expo's asset generator
- Or create simple colored squares as placeholders

The app will work without these, but they're required for production builds.
